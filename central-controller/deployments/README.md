# Steps for running v1 API microservices
Note: Currently we support two kinds of configuration way: Push mode and Pull mode.

Push mode: Configurations that generated by SDEWAN Central Controller will be directly pushed to hub/edge cluster using their kubeconfig which
they provided in the registration. Extra control plane tunnel will be established between Central Controller and edge which does not have a public
IP address.

Pull mode: Configurations will be pushed to public githubs. Hub/edge cluster will pull the configurations from certain directory based on the GitOps
setting(e.g. Fluxv2 configuration) to build up tunnels for data transfer. Hub/edge cluster need to register with pull mode while using that.

### Steps to install packages from yaml

**1. Create Databases used by SDEWAN Central Controller v1 Microservices for Etcd and Mongo**

```
$ kubectl apply -f scc_secret.yaml -n sdewan-system
$ kubectl apply -f scc_mongo.yaml -n sdewan-system
$ kubectl apply -f scc_etcd.yaml -n sdewan-system
```

**2. create SDEWAN Central Controller v1 Microservices**

```
$ kubectl apply -f scc.yaml -n sdewan-system
$ kubectl apply -f scc_rsync.yaml -n sdewan-system
```
